# Challenges
## 1. The Jungle Problem
 
Create the objects that you feel would best model a jungle using your best OO design and coding practices based on the following requirements.
1. The jungle contains several species of animals; tigers, monkeys and snakes.
2. All animals can do three things, make a sound, eat food, and sleep.
3. Each species of animal knows how many others of its kind exist.
4. By default when an animal’s energy level changes, it changes in the following ways:
   1. -3 for making a sound
   2. +5 for eating food
   3. +10 for sleeping
5. The jungle can perform a sound off. This involves all of the animals in the jungle each making their sound, along with reporting their energy level.
6. Tigers get +5 energy for sleeping.
7. Monkeys get +2 energy for eating and -4 energy for making a sound.
8. Some animals have the ability to play.
9. Only monkeys can play. When they do they say "Oooo Oooo Oooo" and get -8 energy. If a monkey doesn't have enough energy to play they say "Monkey is too tired".
10. The jungle contains several types of food; meat, fish, bugs and grain.
11. Tigers can't eat grain because they have sensitive digestive systems.
12. Bonus Item: The jungle can have each animal perform a random activity out of the ones possible for that animal. Include Unit tests if you would like to do so.

## 2. The Encoding Problem

### Problem 1

In this problem we are asking for implementation of a function, f, that encodes a String.

The function f shall accept a String as an input and return the encoded String as a return value.

The encoding algorithm replaces every character in the string with the letter that has exactly the same position when counting backwards from letter “z” (with alphabet sort order in mind.)

Non-alphabet characters are ignored.

Here are three examples:
1. Letter “a" is replaced by letter “z” (because “a” is the first letter of alphabet and “z” is the first letter when counted from the end of the alphabet list.)
2. Letter “c” is replaced by letter “x” (because “c” is the third letter of alphabet and “x” is the third letter of alphabet when counted backwards from letter “z".)
3. Letter “p” is replaced by letter “k” (because “p” is the 16th letter of alphabet and “k” is the 16th letter when counted backwards from letter “z".)
 
Therefore, when string “acp” is encoded, the return value is string “zxk”.

Please write and submit this function with any unit tests that you would like to include.

What would be the result of encoding the String “Errors in strategy cannot be correct through tactical maneuvers”?

### Problem 2

In this problem we are asking for implementation of a function, g, that returns the frequency of alphabet letters in a given string ignoring upper/lower case issues.

Use whatever programming language you are most comfortable with, although we prefer to see standard scripting languages used.

The return format is best demonstrated in an example.

Suppose you are given the String “Hello there! Apple!"

The function g shall return the following structure:

```
{
  a:1,
  b:0,
  c:0,
  d:0,
  e:4,
  f:0,
  g:0,
  h:2,
  i:0,
  j:0,
  k:0,
  l:3,
  m:0,
  n:0,
  o:1,
  p:2,
  q:0,
  r:1,
  s:0,
  t:1,
  u:0,
  v:0,
  w:0,
  x:0,
  y:0,
  z:0
}
```
## 3. The Fizz With The Buzz

If a number is divisible by three, [write a function which] will type out “fizz”. [When] divisible by five, it will type out “buzz”. If divisible by both, it will type out “fizz buzz." If not divisible by either, it will type out the number.
